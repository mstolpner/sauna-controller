2. ‚úÖ **Must comply with all local electrical codes and regulations**
3. ‚úÖ **Must include appropriate safety cutoffs:**
   - Thermal fuses/cutoffs
   - Ground fault protection (GFCI/RCD)
   - Emergency stop switch
   - Over-temperature protection
4. ‚úÖ **Regular safety inspections required**
5. ‚úÖ **Never leave sauna unattended while heating**

**BY USING THIS PROJECT, YOU ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND ALL RISKS.**
