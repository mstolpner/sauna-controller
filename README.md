## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING

**HIGH VOLTAGE SYSTEM - DANGER OF ELECTROCUTION AND FIRE**

This sauna controller interfaces with mains voltage electrical systems (120V/240V) and high-temperature heating elements. Improper installation, modification, or use can result in:

- ⚡ **Electric shock or electrocution**
- 🔥 **Fire hazard**
- 💀 **Death or serious injury**
- 🏠 **Property damage**

### MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:

1. ✅ **Installation MUST be performed by a licensed electrician**
2. ✅ **Must comply with all local electrical codes and regulations**
3. ✅ **Must include appropriate safety cutoffs:**
   - Thermal fuses/cutoffs
   - Ground fault protection (GFCI/RCD)
   - Emergency stop switch
   - Over-temperature protection
4. ✅ **Regular safety inspections required**
5. ✅ **Never leave sauna unattended while heating**

**BY USING THIS PROJECT, YOU ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND ALL RISKS.**
